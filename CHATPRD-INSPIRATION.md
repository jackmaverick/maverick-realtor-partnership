# ChatPRD Design Inspiration - Implementation Notes

## Overview
This document outlines how we adapted design patterns from ChatPRD.ai (via Anima export) to create the Maverick Exteriors Realtor Partnership website using Astro + Tailwind CSS.

- Hover effects for interactivity

**Content adapted for realtors:**
- Payment at closing
- Fast turnaround
- Increase property value
- Contract language
- 3D visualizations
- Local expertise

### 2. Testimonials Section (`TestimonialsSection.astro`)
**Inspired by:** ChatPRD's testimonial card grid with 5-star ratings

**Adaptations:**
- Three-column grid layout (responsive)
- Star ratings at top of each card
- Gradient divider line (pink → purple → blue)
- Avatar circles with gradient backgrounds
- Author name, role, and brokerage details

**Content adapted for realtors:**
